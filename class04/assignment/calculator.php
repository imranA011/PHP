//8. Take an Interface class "Calculator", now take 3 methods in the interface class. They are => sum,substract,multiply,divide . Each method will take two parameters $num1 and $num2. Now take another class named "MyMath" . Now inherit the Calculator class and implement all the methods with working code(means the sum method will take two params and print the sum and so on for other methods). Now finally take index.php , get the MyMath class and call the methods with num1 and num2 and print out the results.




interface Calculator{
    public function sum($num1, $num2);
    public function substract($num1, $num2);
    public function multiply($num1, $num2);
    public function divide($num1, $num2);
}
